5 Python exercises that will help you practice your programming and problem-solving skills.

1. Prime Numbers
Create a function that returns a list of all prime numbers up to a given number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are prime numbers.

2. List Overlap
Write a program that returns a list containing only the common elements between two lists. For example, given the lists [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6], the program should return [3, 4].

3. List Remove Duplicates
Write a function that removes duplicates from a list. For example, given the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

4. Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function that generates the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. For example, the first 10 numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

5. Palindrome Checker
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "radar" and "level" are palindromes.
